I am a third year student in Computer Science specializing in the Software Engineering stream at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Throughout my time at UTSC, I've learned a variety of programming languages (Java, C, Python, Javascript) and used them in an assortment of projects ranging from a regular expression parser to an android application. I've also completed a co-op work term at IBM as a developer, where I was able to gain experience in web development. My time at IBM introduced me to agile development and web frameworks such as Angular JS, Express JS and Spring MVC. In my personal time, I enjoy learning new web technologies and frameworks such as React, Meteor or anything Javascript related. In the future, I hope to have a career as a software developer specifically in mobile and web application development.</p>

I started programming when I started high school in 2009 where I developed an interest in the field of computer science. I have used several programming languages in my life and my favourite langugage, and the one I am most skilled at is Java due to it's object orientation, and how it compiles code at runtime as a high level language. My main interests are in theoritical computer science in particular about algorithms (and it's design), data structures, and automata theory. I am also interested in app development and design in the gaming industry, where I like to study how an app is designed the be massively large and profitable as a game.</p>

Sirim is a double Computer Science and Mathematics major. He is currently working as a member of a CSCC01 group for a project called ‘Open Exoplanet Catalogue’. In next term, Sirim plans to pursue a minor in Statistics. His current interest in Computer Science is a practical computer programming. So far, he took many theoretical courses so he is very excited to do actual coding and to create a useful App. So CSCC01 could be his favorite course that suits his interest. After graduation, he would like to start his career at an App development company or gaming industry like Google, and Riot where he can learn enormous computer programming skills and knowledges. After obtaining programming skills at a company, he plans to develop a fun software and start his own business in future. He also likes traveling and meeting new people so he wants to have an experience working in several different companies in several different countries.</p>

I am specializing in software engineering and if possible also want a minor in statistics. So far, CSCB07 Software Design is my favourite course and so I am looking forward to this class and the project. I have worked on two group projects in the past. The first was in high school where my teammate and I created a solitaire game. The second was in CSCB07 where we created a filesystem that was similar to the one Linux computers. For both of these I used Java, so I am most familiar with this programming language. Since CSCC01 is my first C-level course, I hope to learn a lot and look forward to taking more upper year courses.</p>
